<h1>Gymnastics</h1>
<p>Gymnastics is a sport that includes exercises requiring <em>balance</em>, <i>strength</i>, <b>flexibility</b>, <i>agility</i>, coordination, and endurance. The movements involved in gymnastics contribute to the development of the arms, legs, shoulders, back, chest, and abdominal muscle groups. Alertness, precision, daring, self-confidence, and self-discipline are mental traits that can also be developed through gymnastics. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse and from circus performance skills.</p>
